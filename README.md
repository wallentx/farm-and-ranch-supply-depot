## Usage

#### Adding Supplies

Add a script to the `bin` directory

#### Auto-updating README.md

The Supplies Index of this `README.md` file updates automatically when an Actions Script is added, or modified. In order for the description of an item to be displayed, the file must contain the following string on a single line anywhere within the file:

`## Description: <Your description here on a single line>`

The purpose of this is to take away the task of moving the final plot to slower storage, from the plotting task. Time spent moving final plots can instead be spent on starting new plotting tasks. This script uses https://github.com/z3bra/wendy to watch your buffer directory, and trigger the Excavator upon inotify event 128 - a file rename - which is the last task of the plot creation.
