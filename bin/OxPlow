## Description: OxPlow - Plot creation task. This is executed automatically by the systemd LandBureau service. Please review this file and make changes appropriate for your system.

# This number can be found by evaluating your tmp space with the LandSurvey script. Do not over-budget this value, or you will fill up your -t/-2 and halt plotting.
MAX_PLOTS=17

# This value is your -d buffer volume. This should be fast storage, with enough space to hold the same number of completed plots that you have set for $MAX_PLOTS. These will only be on this volume briefly, as they trigger a task to immediately move them to your slower HDD storage.
BUFFER=/mnt/path/to/your/buffer

# Existing plot discovery
PLOTS=$(pgrep -fa 'chia plots create' | wc -l)

if [[ $PLOTS -lt $MAX_PLOTS ]]; then
	echo "Plowing land."
# Edit this line to match the path appropriate to your system
	source ~/chia-blockchain/activate
